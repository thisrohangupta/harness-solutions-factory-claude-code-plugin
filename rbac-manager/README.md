# Harness RBAC Manager

a terraform template designed to deploy the Harness Solutions Factory RBAC Manager pipeline

## Summary

The Harness RBAC Manager template includes a new pipeline designed to manage User and UserGroup membership via automation. Additionally, within the `.harness/additional` directory are included which provide IDP workflows scoped to manage Account, Organization, and Project level RBAC management.

This Template will created the following resources:
- Harness Pipeline - RBAC_Management

## Providers
This template is designed to be used as a Terraform Module. To leverage this module, an Harness provider configuration must be added to the calling template as defined by the [Harness Provider - Docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/harness/harness/latest/docs).

To aid in the setup and use of this module, we have added a file to the root of this repository called `providers.tf.example`. This file can be used as the basis for configuring your own `providers.tf` file for the calling template

_**Note**: If using this as module as a template, be sure to copy the provider sample file from the root of the repository into this directory prior to execution._
- Save a copy of the file as `providers.tf`
- Either configure the variables as defined or use their corresponding variables.

_**Note**: The gitignore file in this repository explicitly ignores any file called `providers.tf` from commits and changes._

### Terraform required providers declaration

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    harness = {
      source  = "harness/harness"
      version = ">= 0.31"
    }

}

```
