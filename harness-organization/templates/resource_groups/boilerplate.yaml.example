# Harness Resource Group Management
#
# The ResourceGroup name
# When creating a new Harness ResourceGroup, the following is used:
# - name = The name of this file. Hyphens and underscores are converted into spaces
# - identifier = The name of this file. Hyphens and spaces are converted into underscores
#
# *** Special note about creating role bindings for built-in groups. ***
# Harness groups that begin with an underscore are considered native and platform managed items.
# If you would like to modify the role bindings of those groups, you can add to the bindings by
# creating a new file in this directory using the exact identifier.
